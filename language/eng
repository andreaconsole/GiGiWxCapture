00 Place the telescope in a way that it is possible to see at least one star in the window. Adjust the camera settings in order to have a not saturated star in a dark and not noisy sky. Now press the "Orientation" button in order for the software to calculate the camera orientation.
01 Shift the star to 1 cm from the window border by using ONLY THE A.R. MOVEMENT. Then click on the star  in order to store its position.
02 Shift the star to 1 cm from the opposite border of the window by using ONLY THE A.R. MOVEMENT. Then click on the star.
03 degrees. It will be necessary to calculate again the CCD ORIENTATION only if the device is removed or turned. Now choose if to proceed adjusting the azimuth of the mount (option "Star Position - South") or the elevation of the Pole (option "Star Position - E [W]") and then press "Azimuth (or Elevation) Correction". NOTA BENE: the star on the south is to be chosen on the local meridian (the mount balance counterweights lay horizontally). The star at east is to be chosen on the meridian which is perpendicular to the previous one (in order to do so, put the counterweights downwards).
04 Shift the star towards the center of the window with the AR/DEC movements of the mount and then click on it. After a few seconds the first correction values will appear (in pixels).
05 Observe the trend of the "Correction" value. When it keeps settled (Delta will be at around 5-10), press "Calc Correction" in order to get the correction value calculated. Generally, the better the alignment, the slower the convergence.
06 Shift the star inside the small red circle with the A.R./DEC controls. Then move it until it reaches the green line using just the azimuth movement of the mount.
07 Shift the star inside the small red circle with the A.R./DEC controls. Then move it until it reaches the green line using just the movement in height of the mount.
08 Repeat this procedure
09 times.
10 Warning: The error is bigger than in last measurement: 1. if this is the second measurement, you probably need to invert the sense of correction (flag "Invert"); 2. it is likely that the time that you have been waiting is not enough to get the algorithm converged (variation was still too big): try again; 3. the alignment in the perpendicular direction is far worse and prevents from obtaining a more precise global alignment (you then need to work on the other direction before).
11 After making the correction, you can choose if to refine the alignment further (observe how much the star is shifting in time in order to decide, normally for non-fixed stations an error like 50 indicates a very good alignment), move to (or improve) the correction in the other direction or finish the procedure ("End" button).
12 Click on the star chosen for calibration.
13 Choose the guide star and adjust the camera setting in order to have a not saturated star in a dark and not noisy sky. Next, put the star roughly at the central position of the window and proceed with guide calibration. If calibration is already done, just set the guide interval and press "Guide On/Off".
14 degrees. It will be necessary to calculate again the CCD ORIENTATION only if the device is removed or turned. Put the star roughly at the central position of the window and proceed with guide calibration.
15 Verify the guide settings, put the star roughly at central position in the window and adjust the camera setting in order to have a not saturated star in a dark and not noisy sky. Click on the star when ready.
16 Now the self-guide is working. Press "Guide On/Off" to end.
17 The selected COM port is not valid or is busy. Verify and select the correct port.
18 GiGiWxCapture will load the settings registered in the configuration file. Do you want to proceed?
19 Do you want to save the present configuration of the software?
20 The position of the star in the second point is too close to the one registered in the first point: it is necessary to repeat the acquisition procedure for CCD orientation.
21 Calibration in progress... please wait.
22 Calibration successfully registered. In order to use self-guide, please frame the guide star, set the guide interval and press "Guide On/Off".
23 Calibration interrupted. Remember you can always insert the guide parameters manually in the above textboxs. In order to use the self-guide, please frame the guide star, set the guide interval and press "Guide On/Off".
24 I wrote this software primarily to satisfy my own needs, but I'll be very happy if someone finds it useful. If you are using GigiWxCapture, I would very much like to know! please fill in the module herewith and press "Send" to send me your feedback (feel free to fill in just the information you deem appropriate).
25 The parameters of the software are the same as those in the configuration file. Nothing new to save.
26 Configuration saved.
27 Some parameters have been modified from those in the configuration file. Do you want to save the new configuration?
28 Instructions://1. Click on the preview window of your CCD software. GiGiWebCapture will try to automatically find out its boundaries.//2. Manually adjust "vampire" window size and position, if necessary.//3. Click on "OK" button.
29 Do you want to confirm the data you inserted in the module?
30 Press ok and click on the star to measure (for a correct analysis, the star must not be saturated).
31 Do you want to save the image in the capture window?
32 Image saved in ./savedBMP.
33 When this option is activated, a log of Periodic Error data will be written in PE folder (it can be analyzed by PEAS as IRIS file). Remember to note the declination of the alignment star: without this value PE data cannot be analyzed!
34 PET-AC calibrationzione in progress... Press left mouse button to stop. Remember that the calibration is needed only if the hardware is modified.
35 Calibration completed.
36 PET-AC function needs a specific hardware to be used (see on website andreaconsole.altervista.org for further details). To start PET-AC, just left click on the "PET-AC On/Off" button. Remember that, when PET-AC is active, the mouse pointer is blocked. To free the mouse pointer just left click again.
37 PET-AC activated. To stop PET-AC and free the mouse pointer, just left click on the "PET-AC On/Off" button.
38 GiGiWxCapture is a easy-to-use software because the user is guided through the less obvious function by the information shown in a text window. However, since it's quite original, it can be confusing for the first time user. The main idea is that GiGiWxCapture does not connect directly to the camera but captures and analyzes the images coming from the standard CCD capture software, whatever it is. Here a short summary for starting using GiGiWxCapture.////* launch GiGiWxCapture and your favorite CCD capture software (requested);//* press “Select Capture Window” button: a translucent window named “Vampire Window” will appear;//* move the “Vampire Window” within your CCD capture software window (background should be black, hence with the CCD disconnected or covered);//* press “Automatic” button and wait for the software to find the capture window border (or you can manually size and position the "Vampire Window" and then press “Manual” button);//* be sure that the “Vampire Window” is correctly sized and positioned (no need to be picky).////Warning, from this moment you should not move your CCD capture software window or you will need to repeat the above procedure.//FOR FURTHER INFORMATION AND TUTORIALS PLEASE PRESS THE "More Help Online" BUTTON.
